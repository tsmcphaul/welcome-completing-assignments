# Complete Your First Software Engineering Assignment

## Introduction

During this course, you will work on various assignments as you learn to
code. Starting in Phase 1, all assignments will be interactive pieces of curriculum
that require a submission of work. For each assignment, you will need to complete
some work on your local machine, then submit it to Canvas. If the assignment includes
tests, you will need to pass all tests before Canvas will register the assignment as
**Complete**.

You'll first see an assignment's instructions here, in Canvas. Howeer, the work you'll
be doing will be on your local machine. In order to work on an assignment, you'll need
to get it 'forked' and 'cloned' to your computer.

When you've finished your work, you will need to use Flatiron School's submission
tool, the `learn-co` gem, to submit your work on Canvas.

In this lesson, we'll walk through the full process. In fact, this lesson is the first
Canvas assignment you'll be completing on your own! 

Your task for this lesson is to go through the process of downloading, completing,
and submitting your completed assignment. The following steps walk through the process of getting an assignment onto
your computer from Canvas. Follow along using this current assignment.

> **Note:** In order to work on and submit assignments, you will need to connect
> your GitHub account to your Learn.co account. For more information on this,

### A Quick Note on Organizing Work on Your Machine

Through this course, you will be downloading many assignments, so it is important to take
a moment now to think about how you'll organize this work on your computer. You are welcome
to do what you like, but we recommend setting up a directory where you can keep all of your
work for this course.

- Go to your terminal and navigate to your home director by typing `cd ~`
- Create a `Development` folder by typing `mkdir Development` (if you're a mac user, this folder exists)
- Navigate into this folder with `cd Development`
- In here, create a `code` folder with `mkdir code`
- Navigate into this folder with `cd code`

You'll be going through multiple phases in this course, so it may also be helpful to go one step further
and create folders for phases 1 through 5 within `code`.

Having a specific place for your work will make it easier to find if you ever need to look back at an
earlier project. It'll also keep the rest of your computer's folders clear of random code.

The process we'll go through in this lesson will create sub-folders automatically. Whenever you are
starting a new assignment, navigate back to your main `code` folder (`cd ~/Development/code`) to ensure
these sub-folders don't get created _within each other_.

### Starting an Assignment - Forking

On the assignment's page in Canvas, you'll see three buttons in the upper right
corner of the assignment's text. The first is a **Fork** button. When this
button is present, it means this assignment requires work on your local machine.

<figure>
  <img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/fork-link.png" alt="fork link" height="25px">
  <figcaption><sm>This is just a picture, the button is up at the top of the page</sm></figcaption>
</figure>

Forking is a process where an exact copy is made of a collection of code and
files. Clicking the **Fork** button copies our original version of an assignment
over to your personal GitHub account, then redirects you to that new copy.
Forking will allow you to write your own code solution without interfering with
the original copy.

If clicking the **Fork** button does not bring you to GitHub, check to make sure that you
have [connected your GitHub account to Flatiron School][github to learn].

> **Note:** In GitHub, there is a **Fork** button, as well. However, this button
> **will not communicate with Flatiron School** - we won't know you've forked the assignment,
> and your assignment won't submit successfully in Canvas.

### Cloning to Your Local Machine

Once an assignment fork has been created, you'll need to download it to your
local machine. To do this on your personal GitHub fork, first
click the **Code** button. A pop-up will appear that says **Clone with HTTPS**.
You'll see a URL provided starting with `https://...`.

![GitHub code button drop-down](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/git-clone-using-ssh.png)

**Before doing anything else**, make sure to switch from **HTTPS** to **SSH** by
clicking the **Use SSH** link. When clicked, the pop-up will change to display
**Clone with SSH**. Instead of a URL, you'll see what sort of looks like an
email, starting with `git@github.com:`.

![clone with ssh option](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/canvas-welcome/clone-with-ssh.png)

> **Aside:** Why SSH? If you followed the setup instructions, you have added your
> personal SSH key to GitHub. GitHub will store your personal copies of all the work
> you do in this course. Because you've added your SSH key, GitHub will know who you are when you
> send work from your local machine to GitHub to be stored. HTTPS may not work for all
> assignments and will require you to sign-in from your terminal.

From here, click the clipboard icon.

![copy to clipboard button](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/copy-clone-command-button.png)

Now, open to your terminal and navigate to where you'd like to download the
assignment (e.g. `cd ~/Development/code`).

Once you've navigated to where you'd like to store assignments, type
`git clone ` then paste in the copied text from GitHub. It should look
something like this:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-user-name>/welcome-completing-assignments.git
```

Press enter, and you should see a flurry of terminal activity. Once the terminal
gives you control to type again, a new folder with the GitHub name of the
assignment will be present. Change directory into this folder to access the
assignment files.

```sh
cd welcome-completing-assignments
```

Now, if you've set up VS Code, type `code .` to open up a text editor window with
access to all of the assignment's files. The instructions are now also available on
your local machine in `README.md`.

### Completing and Submitting an Assignment

Most assignments will have tests that check your work and provide immediate
feedback in the terminal. We'll walk through some examples in upcoming lessons.

This assignment has a single test: check to see if you've correctly cloned this
assignment to your local machine. If you've followed the steps above, you've
completed everything you need to do to pass the test, all that is left to do is
run it.

To run an assignment's tests, make sure you're still in the assignment's folder
on your local machine, then type the following:

```sh
learn test 
```

This command will again cause a flurry of activity in your terminal. You may see
some warnings in the mix of output, but that is normal. After a few
moments, you should see the test results printed out. For this assignment,
they should look like this:

```sh
This assignment
    âœ“ has been correctly cloned to your local environment


  1 passing (5ms)
```

Congratulations! You've passed the test.

> **Note:** If you did not receive a passing test, or if your terminal produced
> some sort of error, walk through the steps in this lesson again and make sure
> you've followed each one. If you're still receiving errors, we recommend going
> back through the local environment setup instructions again to ensure everything
> is set up properly.

When all tests are passing, you can head back to the assignment on Canvas.
Refresh the assignment page and you should see that Canvas now registers the
assignment as **Complete**, and you will be ready to move on to the next lesson.

Each assignment will be different and will include instructions on what is
required to complete it. Some labs will have many tests. You can run
`learn test` as many times as you'd like while working to solve these labs. You
will submit your work to Canvas each time you do, but the assignment will be
marked **Incomplete** until all tests are passing.

### Your Work in GitHub

Every time you run `learn test`, all the changes you've made locally will be stored
on your GitHub fork of the repo. If you head back to your repo after running `learn test`,
you should see a message that a new branch, `fis-wip`, has been created. This branch
contains the work you've done so far.

## Types of Assignments

For most assignments, you will go through the process we just walked through. In our
curriculum, these assignments are often referred to as **labs** - coding lessons
that include tests. There are a few other types of assignments, though, that
require slightly different submission steps:

- **Code-alongs:** These also require code, but will guide you through what
  needs to be written. There are no tests to pass, but you will still need to go
  through forking, cloning, and running `learn test`.
- **Portfolio Projects:** For these assignments, you'll be building fully functional
  applications. Some guidelines and requirements will be provided, but it will
  be up to you to design and create your own app. These will eventually become
  the projects you showcase to potential employers!
- **Blog Submissions:** Blogs are a required part of our Software Engineering
  courses. They help to develop your online presence and are a great way to
  reinforce the concepts you learn. You'll write your blog posts on a different
  platform, but submit links to them in Canvas.

## Submitting Projects and Blogs

For project and blog assignments, you will not use the forking and cloning process. For projects,
you'll likely be building from scratch rather than forking and cloning existing content. For
blogs, you'll be writing your blog posts on some other platform online.

In both cases, you'll need to manually submit a link to your work on Canvas.
While viewing the assignment, you should see a **Submit Assignment** button in
the upper-right section of the page.

![submit assignment button](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/canvas-welcome/submit-assignment-canvas.png)

Clicking this button will bring you to the bottom of the page where you can
submit a URL link to your work.

![submit assignment form](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/canvas-welcome/submit-assignment-canvas-form.png)

Upon submission you should see confetti appear, indicating that your submission
has been accepted.

> **Note:** It is possible to submit lab and code-along assignments this way.
> However, the assignment will only be marked as submitted, not complete.

## Conclusion

You've completed your first assignment! You now know how to work on and submit
assignments:

- Click the **Fork** button on the Canvas assignment
- Once the assignment is forked, clone it down to your local machine
- Complete any required work, then run `learn test`
- If all tests pass, the assignment will be submitted to Canvas and marked as
  **Complete**
- Your work will also be pushed to GitHub and will be available on the `fis-wip`
  branch

Equipped with this knowledge, you are now ready to tackle greater challenges!
